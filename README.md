I am an enthusiastic full-stack engineer. As a detail-oriented and deep thinker, I thrive on learning new concepts, engaging in critical analysis, and solving complex problems. Each project presents its own set of challenges, but I find immense satisfaction in overcoming them through perseverance and thorough research.

Whereas I've explored complex scientific concepts, building my expertise in medical knowledge, paired with excellent healthcare service, I hope to now bring excellence to your software developer team. I'm truly thankful for the people around me who have given me the opportunity to learn, grow, and work alongside them - I believe in taking every experience, with all the successes and failures, to grow as professional and person.

During my downtime, you'll often find me immersed in designing and crafting my own stickers to share with the kids at my local church on Sundays. And when it's time to unwind, there's nothing quite like a good old-fashioned D&D session with friends.
